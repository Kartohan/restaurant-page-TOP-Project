# restaurant-page-TOP-Project
The task of this project was to create a page with js only. At the beginning, I made a very big mistake by starting to write some very understandable code, I saved it in a folder "old_code" to remind myself that you donâ€™t need to do this. In general, it was very interesting, I discovered new possibilities for using modules, I found out that creating an object and then calling it with "document.querySelector()" changes the original object (for me it was unexpected). <br>
This time I did almost no design. There are standard fonts, there are almost no design elements except, perhaps, pictures. In my opinion, the site without all this looks fine. <br>
22.06.22 - Site works like as i expected. <br>
